The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; /* This rule will not override the previous rule */
}
```

The expected behavior is that `#myElement.myElement` (the most specific selector) should override both `#myElement` and `.myElement`, resulting in green text. However, due to how specificity works in CSS, this does not happen.
