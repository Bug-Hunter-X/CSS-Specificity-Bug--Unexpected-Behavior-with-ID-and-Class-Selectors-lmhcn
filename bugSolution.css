To fix the issue, instead of relying on combining selectors, use a more specific selector with higher specificity or use the `!important` flag (although this is generally discouraged). Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green !important; /* Using !important to override previous styles */
}

/*Alternative Solution*/
#myElement.myElement { 
    color: green;
}
```

This approach ensures the correct override.  Note that using `!important` is generally not recommended for maintaining clean and maintainable CSS.
